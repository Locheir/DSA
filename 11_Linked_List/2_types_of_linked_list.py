### Linked List Types : 

#   * Singly Linked List 
#   * Circular Singly Linked List 
#   * Doubly Linked List
#   * Circular Doubly Linked List 

# 1. Singly Linked List : 
#
# A single node contains Data and Address of the next node. 
# The last node is pointing towards null.
# This type of LL is the simplest one.

# 2. Cirular Singly Linked List :
# 
# A single node contains Data and Address of the next node.
# In this type the last node is pointing towards first node.
# It is cirular in nature.

# 3. Doubly Linked List : 
# 
# A single node contains Data , Address of previous node and Address of the next node.
# We can move in both directions in this type of LL.

# 4. Cirular Doubly Linked List : 
# 
# A single node contains Data , Address of previous node and Address of the next node.
# This is circular in nature.
